# Virtual Try-On in E-Commerce

## Overview

E-commerce is at the forefront of modern retail, offering unparalleled convenience to customers. Despite its rapid growth, certain limitations persist, particularly in the fashion sector.
A major pain point for customers is the lack of a tangible, visual sense of how clothing items
will fit or look on them. This issue results in reduced purchase confidence, high return rates,
and lower customer satisfaction. For retailers, the financial and environmental costs of processing returns are significant. The idea of virtual try-on systems arises from the need to bridge the
gap between the physical and digital shopping experiences. Leveraging artificial intelligence
(AI), computer vision, and AR technologies, VTO systems offer a practical solution by providing customers with a near-realistic visualization of how garments fit. The ability to simulate
clothing on the userâ€™s body not only boosts customer confidence but also reduces return rates
and promotes sustainability in e-commerce
